## Question 5
**I was reading into what dahliaOS is and I find it quite interesting on how simplistic it appears. One of the main things I have noticed in the description is that it states that it's dual kernal approach can allow users with newer hardware to take advantage of the Zircon Kernal while maintaining support for older devices using the old Linux Kernal. I believe it can be useful to utilize in interchangable devices. This distribution also holds other special features like Internet Recovery, which is if something were to go wrong with the OS it will automatically download and boot from the last image it was on. I find that feature useful and doesn't always appear with other OS. It also explains how easy multitasking can be. There is also something called containers in which allow you to transfer older apps into this new OS without issue as long as they are from the containers.**

## Question 6
DistroTest.net is a project that allows you to test Linux/BSD distributions on your web browser. This website is great for trying out distributions before you even download the ISO file. Go to Distrotest.net and click on any of the distributions. Start the distribution and take a screenshot of the browser window that just popped up.
